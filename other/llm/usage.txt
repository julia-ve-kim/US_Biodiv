speciesdat=read.csv("speciesdata.csv")
Error in file(file, "rt") : cannot open the connection
In addition: Warning message:
In file(file, "rt") :
  cannot open file 'speciesdata.csv': No such file or directory
  
ChatGPT
The error message indicates that R cannot find the file 'speciesdata.csv' in the current working directory. Here are a few things to check and try:

Verify File Existence: Double-check that the file 'speciesdata.csv' exists in the directory from which you're running your R script. If it's not there, you'll need to move it to the correct directory or specify the correct path to the file.

Set Working Directory: Make sure you've set the correct working directory in your R script. If your file is not in the same directory as your R script, you'll need to either move the file to the directory where your R script is located or change the working directory in your script using setwd() function.

By addressing these points, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully read the 'speciesdata.csv' file in R.

Check priority numbers are NA or between 1 and 18 
cleaned_spending_data$priority_threat |> min() == 1 
cleaned_spending_data$priority_threat |> max() == 18 
cleaned_spending_data$priority_potential |> min() == 1 
cleaned_spending_data$priority_potential |> max() == 18 
cleaned_spending_data$priority_rarity |> min() == 1
cleaned_spending_data$priority_rarity |> max() == 18 right now i just check 1 to 18 but how to factor in the fact that priority_... can be NA

ChatGPT
To factor in the possibility that the priority columns (priority_threat, priority_potential, priority_rarity) might contain NA values, you can use the is.na() function in combination with your existing checks. Here's how you can modify your checks:

r
Copy code
# Check if priority_threat is within range or NA
priority_threat_valid <- all(ifelse(is.na(cleaned_spending_data$priority_threat), TRUE, cleaned_spending_data$priority_threat %in% 1:18))

# Check if priority_potential is within range or NA
priority_potential_valid <- all(ifelse(is.na(cleaned_spending_data$priority_potential), TRUE, cleaned_spending_data$priority_potential %in% 1:18))

# Check if priority_rarity is within range or NA
priority_rarity_valid <- all(ifelse(is.na(cleaned_spending_data$priority_rarity), TRUE, cleaned_spending_data$priority_rarity %in% 1:18))

# Combine all checks
all_valid <- priority_threat_valid && priority_potential_valid && priority_rarity_valid

# Display the result
if (all_valid) {
  print("All priority columns are valid.")
} else {
  print("Some priority columns are not valid.")
}
This code will check if each priority column is either NA or within the range of 1 to 18. If any of the columns contain values outside this range or are NA when they shouldn't be, it will print that some priority columns are not valid. Otherwise, it will print that all priority columns are valid.

min(simulated_spending_data$priority_threat) = 1 
Error in min(simulated_spending_data$priority_threat) = 1 : 
  could not find function "min<-" is there a package i need
  
ChatGPT
It seems like you're trying to assign a value of 1 to the minimum value in the priority_threat column of your simulated_spending_data dataset. However, the error message indicates that R is interpreting this operation as trying to use a function min<-, which doesn't exist.

To set the minimum value in a column to 1, you can do it in a couple of ways, using base R or with additional packages like dplyr. Here's how you can do it with base R:

R
Copy code
# Find the minimum value in the column
min_value <- min(simulated_spending_data$priority_threat)

# Replace the minimum value with 1
simulated_spending_data$priority_threat[simulated_spending_data$priority_threat == min_value] <- 1
If you prefer to use dplyr, you can do it like this:

R
Copy code
library(dplyr)

simulated_spending_data <- simulated_spending_data %>%
  mutate(priority_threat = ifelse(priority_threat == min(priority_threat), 1, priority_threat))
Make sure you have the dplyr package installed and loaded in your R environment if you choose to use the second method.

ChatGPT
To use your linear regression model (species_spending_model) to make predictions of spending (log), you can use the predict() function in R. Here's how you can do it:

R
Copy code
# Assuming your dataset is named cleaned_spending_data
# Assuming your linear regression model is named species_spending_model

# Make sure to replace 'new_data' with your actual new data for prediction
new_data <- cleaned_spending_data

# Predict spending (log) using the model
predictions <- predict(species_spending_model, newdata = new_data)

# Display the predictions
print(predictions)
This will give you the predicted spending (log) values based on your model and the new data provided. Make sure that the new_data you provide has the same structure and variables as the dataset used to train the model (cleaned_spending_data).

User
put the spending predictions as a new column inside the taxconsmeans tibble: taxconsmeans <- cleaned_spending_data |> 
  # remove rows where status_species is NA
  filter(!is.na(status_species)) |> 
  # filter rows where CommonNameFlag is 0
  filter(CommonNameFlag == 0) |> 
  # group by taxon and status
  group_by(taxon, status_species) |> 
  # calculate median values and uncertainties for each variable
  summarize(
    ngrams_common = median(ngrams_common, na.rm = TRUE),
    ngrams_science = median(ngrams_science, na.rm = TRUE),
    ngenus = log(median(ngenus, na.rm = TRUE)), 
    priority_threat = median(priority_threat, na.rm = TRUE),
    priority_rarity = median(priority_rarity, na.rm = TRUE),
    priority_potential = median(priority_potential, na.rm = TRUE),
    region_num = median(region_num, na.rm = TRUE), 
    conflict = median(conflict, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) 

# generate predictions 
predictions <- predict(species_spending_model, newdata = taxconsmeans)
ChatGPT
To add the spending predictions as a new column inside the taxconsmeans tibble, you can simply use the mutate() function. Here's how you can do it:

R
Copy code
# Assuming your linear regression model is named species_spending_model

# Generate predictions for spending (log) using the model and taxconsmeans data
taxconsmeans <- taxconsmeans %>%
  mutate(spending_prediction = predict(species_spending_model, newdata = .))

# Display the updated tibble
print(taxconsmeans)
This will add a new column named spending_prediction to your taxconsmeans tibble containing the predicted spending (log) values based on your model.

User
can you just take my code & append the data
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's your provided code with the data appending included:

R
Copy code
taxconsmeans <- cleaned_spending_data |> 
  # remove rows where status_species is NA
  filter(!is.na(status_species)) |> 
  # filter rows where CommonNameFlag is 0
  filter(CommonNameFlag == 0) |> 
  # group by taxon and status
  group_by(taxon, status_species) |> 
  # calculate median values and uncertainties for each variable
  summarize(
    ngrams_common = median(ngrams_common, na.rm = TRUE),
    ngrams_science = median(ngrams_science, na.rm = TRUE),
    ngenus = log(median(ngenus, na.rm = TRUE)), 
    priority_threat = median(priority_threat, na.rm = TRUE),
    priority_rarity = median(priority_rarity, na.rm = TRUE),
    priority_potential = median(priority_potential, na.rm = TRUE),
    region_num = median(region_num, na.rm = TRUE), 
    conflict = median(conflict, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) 

# generate predictions 
taxconsmeans <- taxconsmeans %>%
  mutate(spending_prediction = predict(species_spending_model, newdata = .))

# Display the updated tibble
print(taxconsmeans)
This code will first process your cleaned_spending_data as per your specifications, then append a column named spending_prediction with the predicted spending values based on your linear regression model.

User
no use predictions <- predict(species_spending_model, newdata = taxconsmeans). apend this
ChatGPT
Apologies for the misunderstanding. Here's the corrected version with the predictions appended:

R
Copy code

taxconsmeans <- cleaned_spending_data |> 
  # remove rows where status_species is NA
  filter(!is.na(status_species)) |> 
  # filter rows where CommonNameFlag is 0
  filter(CommonNameFlag == 0) |> 
  # group by taxon and status
  group_by(taxon, status_species) |> 
  # calculate median values and uncertainties for each variable
  summarize(
    ngrams_common = median(ngrams_common, na.rm = TRUE),
    ngrams_science = median(ngrams_science, na.rm = TRUE),
    ngenus = log(median(ngenus, na.rm = TRUE)), 
    priority_threat = median(priority_threat, na.rm = TRUE),
    priority_rarity = median(priority_rarity, na.rm = TRUE),
    priority_potential = median(priority_potential, na.rm = TRUE),
    region_num = median(region_num, na.rm = TRUE), 
    conflict = median(conflict, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) 

# Generate predictions and append them
taxconsmeans$spending_prediction <- predict(species_spending_model, newdata = taxconsmeans)

# Display the updated tibble
print(taxconsmeans)
This code calculates the predictions using the predict() function and appends them as a new column named spending_prediction to the taxconsmeans tibble.

rename taxon varialbe as Taxon after predictions
ChatGPT
To rename the taxon variable to Taxon after generating predictions, you can use the rename() function from the dplyr package. Here's how you can integrate it into your script:

R
Copy code
# Rename the 'taxon' variable to 'Taxon' after generating predictions
taxconsmeans <- taxconsmeans %>%
  rename(Taxon = taxon)

# Plot data of predicted log(spending) against assessed conservation status,
# with points shaped according to Taxon
taxconsmeans %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = status_species, y = log_spending_prediction, group = Taxon, col = Taxon, pch = Taxon)) + 
  geom_point(size = 3, stroke = 0.75) + 
  labs(x = "Assessed Conservation Status", y = "Predicted Log(Spending)", fill = "Taxon") + 
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_shape_manual(values = shape_values)  # manually specify shape values
This will ensure that the taxon variable is renamed to Taxon in your taxconsmeans tibble after generating predictions.

Error: object 'ngrams_common' not found???? it worked a minute ago
ChatGPT
The error message indicates that R can't find the ngrams_common variable in your data. This suggests that there might be a typo or some other issue with the column name.

Please double-check the column names in your cleaned_spending_data dataset to ensure they match the names you're using in your analysis code. Make sure there are no typos or missing variables.

If the column names are correct, ensure that your data frame cleaned_spending_data is loaded properly and contains the expected columns. You can inspect the structure of your data frame using str(cleaned_spending_data) or head(cleaned_spending_data) to see the first few rows.

Once you've confirmed the column names and the presence of the necessary variables in your data frame, you should be able to proceed with your analysis without encountering the error.

Thank you for providing the output of head(cleaned_spending_data). It seems that the column names are indeed present, including ngrams_common.

Given that the column names are correct and present in your dataset, the issue might be occurring within the piping operation.

Let's try rewriting the piping operation to see if it resolves the error:

R
Copy code
taxconsmeans <- cleaned_spending_data %>%
  # remove rows where status_species is NA
  filter(!is.na(status_species)) %>%
  # filter rows where CommonNameFlag is 0
  filter(CommonNameFlag == 0) %>%
  # group by taxon and status
  group_by(taxon, status_species) %>%
  # calculate median values and uncertainties for each variable
  summarize(
    ngrams_common = median(ngrams_common, na.rm = TRUE),
    ngrams_science = median(ngrams_science, na.rm = TRUE),
    ngenus = log(median(ngenus, na.rm = TRUE)), 
    priority_threat = median(priority_threat, na.rm = TRUE),
    priority_rarity = median(priority_rarity, na.rm = TRUE),
    priority_potential = median(priority_potential, na.rm = TRUE),
    region_num = median(region_num, na.rm = TRUE), 
    conflict = median(conflict, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
Try running this code and see if it resolves the issue. If the problem persists, there might be another issue at play, and we can further investigate from there.

User
okay, now i want to work again with my model. i want to visualise predictions based on four priority numbers: priority_threat (1 to 3 or NA), priority_potential (1 to 2 or NA), priority_threat (1  2  3 NA) and conflict (0 to 1)
ChatGPT
To visualize predictions based on the four priority numbers (priority_threat, priority_potential, priority_rarity, and conflict), you can create multiple plots, each focusing on one of these variables. Here's how you can do it:

R
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries if not already loaded
library(ggplot2)

# Visualize predictions based on priority_threat
ggplot(taxconsmeans, aes(x = priority_threat, y = log_spending_prediction)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Priority Threat", y = "Predicted Log(Spending)")

# Visualize predictions based on priority_potential
ggplot(taxconsmeans, aes(x = priority_potential, y = log_spending_prediction)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Priority Potential", y = "Predicted Log(Spending)")

# Visualize predictions based on priority_rarity
ggplot(taxconsmeans, aes(x = priority_rarity, y = log_spending_prediction)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Priority Rarity", y = "Predicted Log(Spending)")

# Visualize predictions based on conflict
ggplot(taxconsmeans, aes(x = conflict, y = log_spending_prediction)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Conflict", y = "Predicted Log(Spending)")
This code will create four separate plots, each visualizing the predicted log spending against one of the priority variables (priority_threat, priority_potential, priority_rarity, and conflict) using boxplots. You can customize these plots further according to your preferences.

# generate predictions 
taxconsmeans$log_spending_prediction <- predict(species_spending_model, newdata = taxconsmeans) what is the pros of running the predictions over taxconsmeans in lieu of the original dataset?
ChatGPT
Running predictions over the summarized dataset taxconsmeans rather than the original dataset cleaned_spending_data can have several advantages:

Reduced Complexity: The summarized dataset contains aggregated information, such as median values, for each combination of taxon and status_species. This reduces the complexity of the data, making it easier to analyze and interpret.

Improved Visualization: When visualizing predictions based on taxon, having aggregated data can lead to clearer and more interpretable plots. Instead of visualizing predictions for each individual data point, you're visualizing trends and patterns across groups, which can be more insightful.

Improved Model Performance: In some cases, using summarized data for prediction can lead to improved model performance. Aggregating data can help reduce noise and variability, which may result in more stable and accurate predictions.

Efficiency: By summarizing the data first, you're reducing the number of data points that the model needs to process during prediction. This can lead to faster computation times, especially for large datasets.

Avoidance of Overfitting: By summarizing the data, you're potentially reducing the risk of overfitting, especially if the original dataset contains a large number of observations. Overfitting occurs when a model learns to capture noise in the training data, leading to poor generalization to new data.

Overall, using summarized data for prediction, as in the case of taxconsmeans, can offer a more focused and efficient approach to analyzing and visualizing model predictions, particularly when exploring trends and patterns across groups.

## Model justification

The logistic regression model is most appropriate, because the outcome of interest -- whether or not a species was listed as of August 2020 -- is binary and the covariates used are an admixture of categorical, discrete and continuous variables. Moreover, logistic regression is well suited to the  primary interest of our analysis, which is to *predict* the probability of a species being listed when the values of its covariates are known, and to understand the relative importance of the covariates in making this prediction. The coefficients of logistic regression are especially interpretable to this end, with each giving an indication of the impact of the covariate on the log-odds of the outcome occurring. We utilise this predictive power in ..., where we graph the predicted probabilities of species being listed under the ESA, as implied by the regression coefficients. 

Logistic regression is also advantageous in having relatively simple assumptions to be satisfied. It does not make the key assumptions of linearity, homoscedasticity, independence and normality that are required to apply linear regression and other generalised linear models based on the ordinary least squares algorithm [@Bandgar]. This is well-suited to our scenario, where it would not be sensible, say, to discuss a linear relationship between the taxon to which a species belongs and the log-odds probability of its being listed, or to expect an independence between scientific and common $n$-gram name frequencies. (Indeed, @fig-ngram_distribution already appears to indicate a mild correlation between the two $n$-gram frequencies). Nor does logistic regression require its covariates to be normally distributed or to possess equal variance as other linear classifiers do, such as discriminant function analysis [@Press]. We verify the assumptions that do underlie logistic regression in @sec-model_validation. can you add anything else
ChatGPT
Your justification for using logistic regression as the modeling technique appears solid and comprehensive. However, I can offer some additional points to reinforce the suitability of logistic regression for your analysis:

Robustness to Outliers: Logistic regression is robust to outliers in the independent variables. In ecological studies like yours, outliers are not uncommon due to the inherent variability in natural systems. By not relying heavily on these outliers, logistic regression provides more reliable estimates of the relationships between variables.

Efficiency with Small Sample Sizes: Logistic regression performs well even with relatively small sample sizes, which might be the case in ecological studies, where data collection can be challenging and resource-intensive. This efficiency ensures that you can obtain meaningful results with the available data.

Handling of Non-linear Relationships: While logistic regression assumes a linear relationship between the log odds of the outcome and the independent variables, it can still capture complex non-linear relationships through techniques like polynomial terms or spline functions. This flexibility allows you to model intricate relationships without resorting to overly complex models.

Model Interpretability: Logistic regression provides easily interpretable coefficients, which can be directly translated into odds ratios. These odds ratios allow you to quantify the impact of each independent variable on the likelihood of the outcome, making it easier to communicate your findings to stakeholders and policymakers.

Easy Implementation and Computationally Efficient: Logistic regression is relatively easy to implement and computationally efficient, even with large datasets. This aspect is particularly beneficial when dealing with extensive ecological datasets where computational resources may be limited.

By highlighting these additional strengths of logistic regression, you can further strengthen your justification for choosing this modeling approach in your ecological analysis.

Logistic regression is less inclined to over-fitting what does this mean
ChatGPT
Logistic regression is less inclined to overfitting compared to more complex models like decision trees with many levels or deep neural networks. Overfitting occurs when a model learns to capture noise or random fluctuations in the training data rather than the underlying patterns or relationships. In other words, an overfit model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data because it has essentially memorized the training data rather than learning generalizable patterns.

Logistic regression's simplicity and linearity make it less prone to overfitting for several reasons:

Fewer Parameters: Logistic regression typically has fewer parameters to estimate compared to more complex models. With fewer parameters, the model has less flexibility to fit noise in the data, reducing the likelihood of overfitting.

Linear Decision Boundary: Logistic regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the log-odds of the outcome. While this assumption may not always hold true, it imposes a level of simplicity that can prevent the model from capturing overly complex relationships that might be due to noise.

Regularization Techniques: Regularization techniques like L1 (Lasso) or L2 (Ridge) regularization can be applied to logistic regression to further prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficient values. These techniques encourage the model to focus on the most important features while shrinking the coefficients of less important features.

Model Complexity Control: Unlike highly flexible models such as decision trees or neural networks, logistic regression's simplicity inherently limits its capacity to capture intricate patterns in the data. While this might seem like a limitation, it also reduces the risk of overfitting by constraining the model's complexity.

Overall, logistic regression strikes a balance between model complexity and simplicity, making it less prone to overfitting and often a suitable choice when the goal is to build a model that generalizes well to unseen data.

how does this help with our ecological dataset (about species listing on the ESA, taxons, etc)
ChatGPT
In the context of your ecological dataset concerning species listing on the Endangered Species Act (ESA), taxonomic information, and other relevant factors, logistic regression's resistance to overfitting provides several benefits:

Preventing Spurious Relationships: Ecological datasets often contain numerous variables, including taxonomic classifications, habitat characteristics, population trends, and more. With logistic regression's tendency to avoid overfitting, you can be more confident that the relationships identified between these variables and species listing status are genuine and not simply artifacts of random noise in the data.

Reducing the Risk of Model Complexity: Ecological systems are inherently complex, with many interacting factors influencing species' statuses. By using logistic regression, which imposes a simpler, linear relationship between predictors and the log odds of species listing, you avoid the temptation to create overly complex models that might fit the training data too closely but fail to generalize to new data.

Interpretability for Ecological Insights: Logistic regression coefficients provide clear and interpretable information about the direction and magnitude of the relationships between predictors and the likelihood of species being listed under the ESA. This transparency allows ecologists and policymakers to understand which factors are most influential in determining a species' listing status, aiding in the development of targeted conservation strategies.

Robustness to Small Sample Sizes: Ecological datasets often suffer from small sample sizes due to the challenges of data collection in diverse and sometimes remote environments. Logistic regression's resistance to overfitting means that even with limited data, the model can still provide reliable estimates of the relationships between predictors and species listing status.

Applicability to Policy Decisions: The Endangered Species Act is a crucial piece of legislation designed to protect at-risk species and their habitats. By using logistic regression, which produces reliable and interpretable results, policymakers can make evidence-based decisions about which species are most in need of protection and allocate resources accordingly.

Overall, logistic regression's ability to resist overfitting is advantageous in ecological datasets, where the goal is to accurately identify the factors influencing species listing status and inform conservation efforts effectively.

summary(species_listing_model_stanarm) how to get its AIC value and log likelihood 
ChatGPT
To obtain the AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) value and log likelihood for a species listing model fitted using the 'stanarm' package in R, you can follow these steps:

Fit the species listing model using the 'stanarm' package. For example:
R
Copy code
library(stanarm)

# Assuming 'y' is your response variable and 'x1', 'x2', etc. are your predictor variables
model <- stan_glm(y ~ x1 + x2 + ..., family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = your_data)
Replace 'y', 'x1', 'x2', etc. with the names of your response and predictor variables respectively, and 'your_data' with the name of your dataset.

Once the model is fitted, you can extract the AIC value and log likelihood from the model object using the 'summary()' function:
R
Copy code
summary(model)
This will display a summary of the fitted model, including the AIC value and log likelihood. You can find them in the output under the respective headings.

Alternatively, you can access these values directly from the model object:

R
Copy code
model$aic
model$logLik
Replace 'model' with the name of your fitted model object.

These steps should allow you to obtain the AIC value and log likelihood for your species listing model fitted using the 'stanarm' package in R.

User
returns null bothtimes
ChatGPT
Apologies for the confusion. It seems I made an error in the previous response. The stan_glm() function from the stanarm package does not directly provide AIC and log likelihood values in the same way as some other functions in R do.

However, you can calculate the AIC value and log likelihood manually using the log-likelihood function and the number of parameters estimated in the model. Here's how you can do it:

R
Copy code
library(stanarm)

# Fit the model
model <- stan_glm(y ~ x1 + x2 + ..., family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = your_data)

# Get log likelihood
log_likelihood <- sum(dbinom(your_data$y, size = 1, prob = predict(model, type = "response"), log = TRUE))

# Get number of parameters
num_params <- length(coef(model))

# Calculate AIC
AIC_value <- -2 * log_likelihood + 2 * num_params

# Output AIC and log likelihood
print(AIC_value)
print(log_likelihood)
Replace y, x1, x2, etc. with the names of your response and predictor variables, and your_data with the name of your dataset.

This code calculates the log likelihood using the dbinom() function and then calculates the AIC value using the formula AIC = -2 * log likelihood + 2 * number of parameters. This approach should give you the AIC value and log likelihood for your model fitted using the stan_glm() function.

Word for human-related (like human-caused is anthropogenic)

ChatGPT
The term you're looking for is "anthropocentric." This term refers to something that is centered around or focused on human beings or human interests.

User
The Endangered Species Act (ESA), reputed as the United States' strongest environmental law, empowers the federal government to protect listed species from extinction. This paper replicates a statistical analysis of the main determinants of actual government decisions about the ESA listing of endangered species. We apply secondary research to estimate how species listing will change over the 21st century due to climate change, regarded as the most serious and persistent threat to biodiversity. The results indicate that higher likelihoods of ESA listing are heavily biased towards vertebrate species and are associated with greater endangerment, greater evolutionary uniqueness, and higher utility value to humans, the latter as measured by Google Ngram frequencies. Unmitigated climate change would warrant the listing of an additional 690 species, with several thousand more becoming critically imperiled but remaining unlisted. These findings emphasise the roles of both scientific and anthropocentric characteristics in the listing decision, and highlight the importance of climate change mitigation efforts in maintaining a sustainable ESA listing rate.

The Endangered Species Act (ESA), renowned as one of the United States' most robust environmental laws, grants authority to the federal government to safeguard listed species from extinction. This study replicates a statistical analysis of the primary factors influencing actual governmental decisions regarding the ESA listing of endangered species. Employing secondary research, we project how species listings will evolve over the 21st century due to climate change, acknowledged as the most severe and enduring threat to biodiversity. Our findings suggest that the likelihood of ESA listing is significantly skewed towards vertebrate species and is correlated with higher levels of endangerment, greater evolutionary distinctiveness, and increased utility value to humans, as measured by Google Ngram frequencies. Unchecked climate change would necessitate the listing of an additional 690 species, with several thousand more reaching critically imperiled status but remaining unlisted. These results underscore the roles of both scientific and anthropocentric characteristics in the listing decision-making process and underscore the critical importance of efforts to mitigate climate change in sustaining a viable ESA listing rate.

It seems there's an issue with the number of rows in your summary table compared to the data you're passing into it.

The error message arguments imply differing number of rows: 17, 1, 0 indicates that there is a mismatch in the number of rows between the data frames or vectors being passed into the hux() function.

To troubleshoot this issue:

Check Data Frames: Ensure that the data frames or vectors you're passing into hux() have compatible dimensions. For example, if you're passing multiple data frames, make sure they have the same number of rows.

Check Data Preparation: Review the code where you're preparing the data for the summary table. Ensure that the data manipulation steps are correct and result in data frames with the expected dimensions.

Debugging: Print out the data frames or vectors just before passing them into hux() to inspect their dimensions and contents. This can help identify where the mismatch is occurring.

Once you've identified and resolved the mismatch in dimensions, you should be able to generate the summary table without encountering the error.
